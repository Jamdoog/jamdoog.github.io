This also applies to RedHat’s Identity Management (IDM) which is their commercial version of FreeIPA. While documentation of the LDAP provider exists, I could only find 1 example of this online from a few years ago. This post is more of a reference point then a ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>QEMU Guest Agent on pfSense</title><link href="https://jamdoog.github.io/posts/guest-agent-on-pfsense/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="QEMU Guest Agent on pfSense" /><published>2022-05-26T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2023-03-18T13:27:33+00:00</updated> <id>https://jamdoog.github.io/posts/guest-agent-on-pfsense/</id> <content src="https://jamdoog.github.io/posts/guest-agent-on-pfsense/" /> <author> <name>James</name> </author> <summary> A piece of software I always found fascinating about hypervisors was the concept of a guest agent. The first example I recall was file sharing from a VMWare Host to Guest on Workstation which seemed genius, removing the need for either USB or Network approaches to traditional file sharing. Forward to now, my virtualization needs have since expanded to a completely seperate home server with P... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Taking advantage of free S3 compatible storage on a £0.30 VPS</title><link href="https://jamdoog.github.io/posts/scaleway-s3-stardust/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Taking advantage of free S3 compatible storage on a £0.30 VPS" /><published>2021-09-30T00:00:00+01:00</published> <updated>2023-03-18T13:27:33+00:00</updated> <id>https://jamdoog.github.io/posts/scaleway-s3-stardust/</id> <content src="https://jamdoog.github.io/posts/scaleway-s3-stardust/" /> <author> <name>James</name> </author> <summary> This post is not meant to be used in a production workflow. I just wanted to show how you can host some data for practically free while being under your OWN terms I have a problem with renting too many virtual servers purely because they are cheap and after recently discovering Scaleway’s offer of a 1GB VPS for £0.30 a month, I had to find a use for some of the idling compute.

In a virtualization stack, it allows us to remove the VMM layer of virtualization and address hardware directly. Scott’s Weblog explains this in further detail.
