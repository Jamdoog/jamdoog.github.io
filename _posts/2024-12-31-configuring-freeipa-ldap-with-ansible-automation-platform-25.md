### Introduction

This is a quick blog post to highlight integrating FreeIPA's LDAP(S) into the recent Ansible Automation Platform 2.5.

This also applies to RedHat's Identity Management (IDM) which is their commercial version of FreeIPA.

While documentation of the LDAP provider exists, I could only find 1 example of this online from a few years ago.

### Configuring

I will update this at a later time with details explaining a bit more, but for now here is the details I used:
